Fluid layouts are useful because they allow a website to make better use of available screen
space. On a large screen, stretching or rearranging elements to fill the space can improve
the user experience by presenting more information at once and eliminating the need for 
scrolling. As users increasingly browse the web on mobile devices, fluid layouts also become
important for adapting websites to small screen sizes. Instead of letting the mobile browser
zoom out on a large page, it is a better idea to scale the width of the page down and rethink
the presentation of information.
